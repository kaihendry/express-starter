A nodejs express serverless template ðŸš€

## Goals

Figure out best practices for a super simple http interface using Javascript.

I do MUCH prefer [Go for Web
apps](https://github.com/kaihendry/go-web-dynamo-starter), though sometimes
client has a NodeJS codebase. ðŸ¤·

## TODO

Figure out if I need should redo logging (I want them structured)

Can I develop locally without serverless offline?

Figure out contract testing, e.g. a post to /fill has the desired input in the output
